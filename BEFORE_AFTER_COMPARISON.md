## Side-by-Side Code Comparison

### 1. Imports

**BEFORE** ❌
```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, Input
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
```

**AFTER** ✅
```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, Input, Dropout          # Added Dropout
from tensorflow.keras.callbacks import EarlyStopping                # Added EarlyStopping

from sklearn.utils.class_weight import compute_class_weight         # Added compute_class_weight
```

### 2. Feature Scaling

**BEFORE** ❌
```python
# No scaling at all!
x_train, x_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(x, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42, stratify=y)
# Directly to model training...
```

**AFTER** ✅
```python
x_train, x_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(x, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42, stratify=y)

# NEW: Scale the features
scaler = StandardScaler()
x_train = scaler.fit_transform(x_train)
x_test = scaler.transform(x_test)
```

### 3. Class Weights

**BEFORE** ❌
```python
# No class weights at all!
# All classes treated equally despite imbalance
```

**AFTER** ✅
```python
# NEW: Compute balanced class weights
weights = compute_class_weight("balanced", classes=np.unique(y_train), y=y_train)
class_weights = dict(zip(np.unique(y_train), weights))
print("Class weights:", class_weights)
# Output: {0: 1.224, 1: 1.085, 2: 1.015, 3: 1.025, 4: 0.841, 5: 1.006, 6: 0.895}
```

### 4. Model Architecture

**BEFORE** ❌
```python
model = Sequential([
    Input(shape=[25]),
    Dense(25, activation="relu", name="Layer_In"),
    Dense(12, activation="relu", name="Layer_H2"),
    Dense(7, activation="softmax", name="Layer_Out")
])
# Total params: 1,053
# No dropout, only 2 hidden layers
```

**AFTER** ✅
```python
model = Sequential([
    Input(shape=[25]),
    Dense(64, activation="relu", name="Layer_In"),
    Dropout(0.2),                                      # Added
    Dense(32, activation="relu", name="Layer_H2"),
    Dropout(0.2),                                      # Added
    Dense(16, activation="relu", name="Layer_H3"),    # Added
    Dense(7, activation="softmax", name="Layer_Out")
])
# Total params: 4,391
# 3 hidden layers with dropout for regularization
```

### 5. Early Stopping

**BEFORE** ❌
```python
# No early stopping at all!
model.fit(x_train, y_train, 
          epochs=40,                    # Fixed 40 epochs
          batch_size=16, 
          validation_data=(x_test, y_test))
```

**AFTER** ✅
```python
# NEW: Set up early stopping
early_stopping = EarlyStopping(
    monitor='val_loss',
    patience=15,
    restore_best_weights=True,
    verbose=1
)

model.fit(x_train, y_train, 
          epochs=150,                             # More epochs but...
          batch_size=32,                          # Better batch size
          validation_data=(x_test, y_test),
          class_weight=class_weights,             # Use class weights
          callbacks=[early_stopping])             # Stop when appropriate
# Automatically stopped at epoch 120!
```

## Training Behavior Comparison

### BEFORE ❌ - Overfitting Pattern
```
Epoch 1/40:  val_loss: 1.1668
Epoch 15/40: val_loss: 1.1581  ← Lowest
Epoch 38/40: val_loss: 1.1942  ← Getting worse!
Epoch 40/40: val_loss: 1.1611  ← Still worse than epoch 15

Final Validation Accuracy: 68.39%
```
**Problem**: Loss was increasing, clear overfitting, no mechanism to stop

### AFTER ✅ - Healthy Training Pattern
```
Epoch 1/150:   val_loss: 1.8599
Epoch 50/150:  val_loss: 1.0489
Epoch 100/150: val_loss: 0.9513
Epoch 120/150: val_loss: 0.9388  ← Best
Epoch 135/150: val_loss: 0.9412  ← Not improving, stopped!

Final Validation Accuracy: 72.80%
```
**Solution**: Steady improvement, early stopping at the right time

## What Each Fix Does

### ✅ StandardScaler
- **Why**: Neural networks need normalized inputs
- **Impact**: All features on the same scale (mean=0, std=1)
- **Without it**: Features with large values dominate learning

### ✅ Class Weights
- **Why**: Dataset has imbalanced classes (225-327 samples)
- **Impact**: Model learns all classes equally well
- **Without it**: Bias toward majority classes

### ✅ Dropout Layers
- **Why**: Prevents overfitting
- **Impact**: Forces network to learn robust features
- **Without it**: Model memorizes training data

### ✅ Early Stopping
- **Why**: Finds optimal training duration
- **Impact**: Stops before overfitting occurs
- **Without it**: Wastes time or overfits

### ✅ Deeper Architecture
- **Why**: More capacity to learn patterns
- **Impact**: Better representation of complex relationships
- **Without it**: Limited learning capacity

### ✅ Better Batch Size
- **Why**: More stable gradient estimates
- **Impact**: Smoother convergence
- **Without it**: Noisy training

## Conclusion

**What you did wrong:**
1. ❌ Forgot to scale features
2. ❌ Didn't handle class imbalance
3. ❌ No regularization (dropout)
4. ❌ No early stopping
5. ❌ Too simple architecture
6. ❌ Suboptimal hyperparameters

**All fixed!** The model now follows neural network best practices and achieves **72.80% accuracy** (up from 68.39%), much closer to CatBoost's 78.76%.

The remaining gap to CatBoost (5.96%) is expected because:
- CatBoost is a gradient boosting algorithm specifically designed for tabular data
- Neural networks generally perform better on unstructured data (images, text)
- Further improvements are possible with more tuning
